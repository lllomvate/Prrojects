### "Exploratory Data Analysis of Physical Activity."
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) of physical activity of 30 participants using Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly). Data on 563 features were processed, key dependencies were visualized, hypotheses were tested, patterns were identified, and categories of activity were identified. Clustering was used. methods, data density visualization, and correlation analysis for preparing data for machine learning.
